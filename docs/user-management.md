## Users

This documents describes how it expecets the users of the OMP to be managed and
how they are allowed to interact with different entities.

Right now the following classes of users are defined:

1. Players
2. Coaches
3. Funtionary

The first two calsses are pretty straightforward. Functionaries are people who
are doing work for the club but no metrics are collected for.

Both Players and Coaches can sign up to the platform for themselves
(self-service) but will only be allowed on the platform if the club they have
choosen is accepting them.

Funtionaries can only be created by the root user.

When a Coach joins a Team he unlocks certrain operations to manage the team.
